Experiment 4 - Data Wrangling and Data Visualization

# I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will
be used in data wrangling and data visualization
# II. Instructions:
Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset and write a
Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter
notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

#### ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM: 
Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.

##### 1. Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas

Output:

### a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon

#### Graphical Representation

### b. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female

#### DataFrame Representation

##### 2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade.

### Does chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?

To answer the question, based from the graph bar above, there is no correlation of the different features to the overall average scores of each category.


# Personal Challenges from this Experiment

I got stuck pretty bad at the graphical representation, I had to look up additional information online to fully grasp the concept of the matplotlib library. The other codes were from the previous lesson of pandas so I got pretty used to it.
